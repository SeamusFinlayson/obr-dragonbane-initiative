# Dragonbane Initiative for Owlbear Rodeo

This extension can be enabled in your Owlbear Rodeo room using this link: https://nboughton.uk/apps/obr-dragonbane-initiative/manifest.json

# Using The Extension

This extension adds an Add/Remove button to token context menus so you can right click some a token or selection of tokens and add them to the tracker.

Clicking on a token name within the tracker allows you to set the ferocity, and you can use the lock/unlock buttons to retain initiative across rounds.
