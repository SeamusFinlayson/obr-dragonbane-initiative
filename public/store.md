# Dragonbane Initiative Tracker

Dragonbane uses a set of cards from 1 - 10 to draw initiatve each round of combat. This extension allows you to add map tokens to the tracker and then draw their cards each round.

Clicking the name of a combatant in the tracker will also allow you to set their ferocity, HP, WP, and provide a custom label.

Clicking an individual card allows you to explicitly set its value, and mark it as kept for subsequent rounds. Click UPDATE when done setting values or END TURN to mark the card blank. Note that if you have opted to keep the card it won't turn blank as its value is retained for until you unselect the 'Keep Card' checkbox.
